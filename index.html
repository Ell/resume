                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>I've been coding professionally for over 8 years, with a focus mainly on web development using python or
                    javascript as my go-to tool for the task. I love working with the web and creating well-documented and
                    easy to use products for other people to use. During my spare time I enjoy hacking on new and interesting
                    technologies that I've discovered around the internet and create fun little projects for my own amusement.</p>
